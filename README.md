## Installation Quick Guide
Assuming you already have Node, go, and Postgresql installed
> &nbsp;
> NOTE: Use `brew list` to check your casks and and formulae already installed
> &nbsp;

#### Install [golang-migrate cli](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate?tab=readme-ov-file#migrate), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [buf](https://buf.build), [sqlc](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/), and [minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/macos/index.html)
```shell
brew install golang-migrate
brew install pnpm
brew install bufbuild/buf/buf
brew install sqlc
brew install minio/stable/minio
```

## Quick Start
#### 1. Install server go modules
```shell
go mod tidy
```
#### 2. Next, install protoc-gen-connect-go
```shell
go install connectrpc.com/connect/cmd/protoc-gen-connect-go@latest
[ -n "$(go env GOBIN)" ] && export PATH="$(go env GOBIN):${PATH}"
[ -n "$(go env GOPATH)" ] && export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}"
```
#### 3. Ensure the following is included in you `.zshrc` or related profile
```
# .zshrc or .bash_profile or whatever
alias air='~/go/bin/air'
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```
#### 4. Now install client node modules
```shell
pnpm install --dir client
```
#### 5. You'll need to create a database for **salon** and grant permissions to admin

```shell
CREATE DATABASE salon;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE salon TO admin;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO admin;
```
Depending on the name you choose for the database you'll need to update the reference in 2 places:
```shell
# /server/.env
export POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://admin:admin@localhost:5432/<DB_NAME>?sslmode=disable
```

```Makefile
# Makefile
models:
	pg_dump --schema-only <DB_NAME> > server/schema.sql
	sqlc generate -f server/sqlc.yaml
```
#### 6. Create account with Mailtrap that you'll use to test emails (important for sign-up/in flows)
1. [Sign-up](https://mailtrap.io/register/signup) with Mailtrap
2. Navigate to [email testing](https://mailtrap.io/inboxes)
3. Add a project
4. Add an inbox (Not sure if this happens automatically)
5. Copy username and password for your project and set them to `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` respectively inside your `/server/.env`
#### 7. Export config env file for minio
```shell
export MINIO_CONFIG_ENV_FILE=/etc/default/minio
```
#### 8. Run the make commands for setting things up
> &nbsp;
> NOTE: depending on where you want your minio store to be you'll need to update the Makefile
> &nbsp;

```Makefile
minio:
  minio server  --console-address :9001 ./data
```
```shell
make minio
make migrate-up
make models
make codegen
```
#### 9. Run the application ðŸŽ‰
```
make dev
```
